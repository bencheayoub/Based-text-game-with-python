In the continent of Aspada, 500 years ago, there lived 50 million humans under the servitude of 50 thousand beings called "Kaidoz," hybrids between humans and dragons possessing immense power. After two thousand years of enslavement and offering sacrifices to them, three wars were waged against them, all of which failed.

Ten years after the last war against them, Mihawk, Sasaki, and Ryoma, the strongest men on the continent, decided to eliminate all the Kaidoz. Their power had terrorized the Kaidoz's realm, with each of them wielding a legendary weapon.

Mihawk possessed a sword called Yuro, so powerful that it could cleave a whole mountain with one strike, crafted by the most skilled blacksmith in history.

Sasaki had a gemstone named Anma that multiplied its wielder's power every time they received a blow. Legend has it that this gem was a gift from the King of Djinn to the sorcerer Tarish after he saved his daughter.

As for Ryoma, he had a glove called Sinistro with a hole on the palm, granting the ability to stop time and rewind it 20 seconds, increasing the wielder's strength. This glove was stolen from the Timelems, creatures from the parallel world.

When these weapons gathered with their powerful wielders, they managed to eradicate the Kaidoz in the Fourth Kaidoz War and sealed them in a jar placed inside a cave called "Canavar," the same name as their leader, due to the immense power of these weapons. However, the users of these weapons died a month later after suffering from excruciating pain.

Part One: Exiting Storm City

Our story begins with a person named Kyoku Bankai. His mother's condition worsened until he summoned a doctor, who diagnosed her with a rare illness. He must now obtain the ingredients for the medicine to cure his sick mother. The doctor also informed him that none of these ingredients are available in his city and advised him of the cities where he can find them. Thus, he sets out to other cities to search for them, and thus begins our adventure to save his mother from death.

First, let's get to know our hero. He is Kyoku Bankai from a remote village in Storm City, raised by his mother and grandfather. His grandfather taught him martial arts, and he became very strong. When his grandfather passed away, his mother took care of him, becoming his motivation to continue learning martial arts to be able to protect her.

As he set out, he encountered a group of highway robbers, whom he defeated easily. They were no match for him.

Here is the list of medicine ingredients:

1. Chamomile herb (rosenbelle)
2. Black elderberry herb (winterland)
3. Ginseng herb (bummer)
4. Echinacea herb (savana)
5. Ginkgo Biloba herb (canavar)

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Part Two: Rosenbelle

Bankai entered the city of Rosenbelle, one of the most beautiful cities in the Aspada continent. He asked some of the vendors in the city if anyone knew about the chamomile herb, but nobody knew its whereabouts. However, a blacksmith named Jinbi directed him to an old man named Ganbi who knew a lot about herbs.

Bankai went to the place of the old man and was told that he wouldn't reveal the herb's location until Bankai solved his riddle. He handed Bankai a cup of water and said, "A man without legs amidst the stars." Bankai quickly answered, "The mermaids," as it referred to creatures of the sea rather than those in the sky. Ganbi then informed him that the herb could be found in the king's palace and grows only once a year.

Bankai went to negotiate with the king, but the king refused until two days later because his daughter's wedding with the prince of Suduma Kingdom was scheduled for the next day. When he returned to the city to find a place to sleep, he heard a voice calling out to him...

It was John, his childhood friend and one of his grandfather's students. John invited him to his house, where they reminisced about their childhood days and their friend Martin, who was also one of their grandfather's students.

In the dark night, as they talked, they heard screams outside. Bankai went to investigate and found the old man Ganbi lying on the ground, surrounded by three people wearing the formal attire of Suduma Kingdom, one of whom was the prince. Ganbi accused them of plotting to take over Rosenbelle Kingdom by marrying off the princess to the prince of Suduma. In anger, the prince raised his sword and struck him down, intending to kill him.

Bankai returned to John and told him what he saw. John wasn't surprised by the prince's actions, knowing it was in line with Suduma Kingdom's practices of conquering other kingdoms. Now, Bankai wanted to save Rosenbelle Kingdom.

The next day, Bankai went with his friend to the wedding venue. When they tried to enter, the gatekeeper stopped them. So, they went to a window, climbed the wall, and sneaked into the castle without being seen by the guards.

Bankai silently observed the attendees, particularly those from Suduma Kingdom, to find a way to stop the king's assassination. They spotted the same three individuals from the previous night, one of whom had a gun hidden in his pocket. When the assassin pulled out the gun, Bankai jumped on him, causing the bullet to hit the Suduma prince, killing him. Bankai saved Rosenbelle Kingdom.

Initially shocked, everyone eventually accepted the turn of events. The Suduma Kingdom delegation was small, with few military figures present, to avoid suspicion from Rosenbelle's residents. Therefore, the king of Suduma ordered the withdrawal of their delegation.

After the incident, the king of Rosenbelle invited Bankai to hear his story, impressed by his bravery and determination to save his mother. The king gave Bankai the chamomile herb, and he left Rosenbelle Kingdom with his friend John.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Part Three: Winterland

Our hero arrived in Winterland, the coldest city in the Aspada continent. His mission here was to find the black elderberry herb. He entered the market to search for it and was delighted to find it available with one of the vendors. However, his joy was short-lived as the price was too high for him to afford.

Bankai asked the vendor if there was another way to obtain the herb. The vendor replied that it grows above the Devil's Hole, where Rasputin's grave is, who died from the city's cold. John quickly solved the riddle, as Rasputin was known for his mysterious death from poison and bullets, but ultimately succumbed to the cold.

Bankai and John went to the graveyard where the graves of prominent figures were buried to search for Rasputin's grave. They found the guard at the graveyard gate, who refused to let them in. Unable to find a way in, they went back to the vendor to inquire again about gaining entry.

On their way to the vendor, they coincidentally met the king of Winterland, the youngest king in the Aspada continent. He shook Bankai's hand firmly and thanked him for his actions in Rosenbelle Kingdom, as he didn't want their princess to marry the Suduma prince, whom he hated, and wanted to marry her himself.

The king asked about their visit to the graveyard and how they knew about Suduma Kingdom's plan. Bankai recounted his story and about his mother's illness, and the death of the old man Ganbi. The king then invited them to accompany him to the graveyard, as he wanted to visit his father's grave, who died in the Third Kaidoz War twelve years ago, and he assumed the throne at the age of six.

After a series of conversations, they parted ways. Bankai asked John if the previous king of Winterland took the throne a year after Rasputin's death and died twenty-three years later, doesn't that mean the current king is the son of the prince who tried to kill Rasputin?

John replied, "No, Rasputin didn't die then. He faked his death and was the one who killed the previous king of Winterland in the Third Kaidoz War as revenge for his attempt on his life, then disappeared."

Not only that, but even the three legends from the Kaidoz War didn't die from any illness; it was just a myth to prevent anyone from searching for the legendary weapons. Bankai recalled Jinbi, who died in Rosenbelle Kingdom at the hands of the Suduma prince.

Bankai: "Yes, what about him?"

It was Ryoma who used the Sinistro glove and weakened due to excessive use of its power. So it was easy for the Suduma prince to kill him. Also, your father, Mihawk, was the strongest among them. He is your father."

Bankai couldn't comprehend what his friend said at first. He asked in shock, "How do you know all this?"

His friend replied, "My parents told me."

Bankai went to the fake grave of Rasputin and took the black elderberry herb. Bankai and John stayed the night in Winterland. Bankai couldn't sleep due to thoughts about his father Mihawk and why he didn't return. They set out in the morning for their next destination, the city of Bummer.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Part Four: Bummer

After the events in the kingdom of Winterland, Bankai and John arrive in the city of Bummer, a city quite different from the ones they've encountered before. It's not as beautiful as the Kingdom of Rosenbelle or Winterland. The people living there are more akin to Vikings, and it's the only city that rejects royal rule, instead being governed by strength alone.

As usual, Bankai heads to where people gather to search for the Ginseng herb. On his way to the market, he stumbles upon the Hal Combat Tournament. The Ginseng herb is one of the prizes for the winner, so without hesitation, both Bankai and John register for the competition. People from other kingdoms also participate.

The rules of the competition are simple: 32 fighters, 5 rounds, and each winner advances to the next match. Anyone who falls, steps out of the ring, or surrenders loses. All weapons are allowed.

The preliminary results reveal that Bankai and John are on completely different sides, meaning they won't face each other until the final round. Initially relieved by this outcome, Bankai's joy is short-lived when he realizes he'll be facing the previous tournament champion, the Wanderer, in his first round. As for John, he'll face one of the strongest individuals from the Suduma kingdom, Ares, if he makes it to the semi-finals. Ares, known as the Armored, is a formidable warrior, his strength rivaling that of the three legends. He wears iron armor, covering his entire body except for his piercing red eyes.

Before the competition begins, Bankai notices Martin's name on the list of competitors. Yes, it's their childhood friend Martin, who was also a disciple under his grandfather. Bankai searches for him in the waiting room and indeed finds Martin, their childhood friend. Finally, the trio is reunited.

The first round commences:
John and Martin easily defeat their opponents.

Bankai, however, struggles in his fight against the Wanderer. The fight begins with rapid successive strikes from the Wanderer, which Bankai manages to deflect. Then, Bankai lands a hit that surprises everyone, causing the Wanderer, the legend of Hal, to lose in the first round at the hands of a traveler whose aim wasn't wealth or the Hal title but merely the herb.

Now, Bankai becomes the center of attention for all the competitors, the talk of the town.

The second round:
The fights are easy for both Bankai and John, drawing even more attention from spectators. Fighters from the Storm Kingdom easily defeat our heroes' opponents.

However, Martin loses his match against Ares, who shows no mercy. Only the intervention of the referee prevents Martin's death, and luckily, his injuries aren't severe.

The third round:
This time, Bankai fights another formidable opponent and wins, albeit with some injuries tended to by the Hal competition's doctors.

Similarly, John fights a warrior from the Savana Kingdom known for their strength and toughness.

Before heading into the fourth round, the remaining contestants are given some time to rest and prepare for their next matches.

During this break, John and Bankai, along with Martin, reminisce about their adventures and childhood days. Suddenly, Ares, who will face John in the next round, appears. After learning that John is Bankai's friend who killed their prince days ago, Ares tells John to withdraw and let him face Bankai. Otherwise, he'll kill John in the final round and then kill Martin, John's ailing friend. Initially reluctant, John agrees after Ares whispers something in his ear.

The fourth round:
Bankai wins against his opponent as usual, but on John's side, he sees his friend withdrawing as soon as he enters the ring. Bankai initially thinks John withdrew out of fear for what happened to their friend Martin or to protect him from Ares, but John has a secret unknown to anyone, even Bankai. Ares whispered to John, "You've made the right choice," drew his sword, and killed John with it. John falls to the ground, and Bankai rushes to him, screaming, "John! The doctors couldn't do anything. John's dead."

Ares looks at Bankai and says, "Don't let your tears hinder you in our next battle." At that moment, Bankai screams in despair, turning all that sadness into anger. Without waiting for the referees to announce the start of the match, Bankai starts it himself. He moves John's body away from the ring and begins their fight.

The final round:
The fight starts with weak strikes from Bankai that do nothing but amuse Ares. Ares raises his hand to the sky and then strikes Bankai, knocking him down. He says, "I told you not to let your sorrow hinder you, or else you'll die from the next blow."

Bankai gets up, looking at the audience, who watches him with pity. He sees Martin crying silently, shocked by the death of their friend John. The voices around him fade until Bankai loses consciousness. One of the referees comes to announce Bankai's defeat and Ares's victory, whose laughter fills the arena. But suddenly, Bankai's body moves, shocking everyone. The shock of Bankai standing with white oval eyes, a tattoo extending from his right eye to his neck and covering part of his right hand, and a black aura emanating from his body terrifies all the attendees. It resembles the Kaidoz form.

Finally, Bankai allows his true power to emerge. Ares prepares to continue the fight, but Bankai strikes him down, finally winning. After the fight, Bankai's strength collapses, and he remains in a coma for three days. When he wakes up, the doctor tells him he couldn't understand his condition during the fight and advises him to see a doctor in the city of Savana, who might be able to help him.

Bankai goes with his friend Martin to their friend's grave, then collects his prize and takes the Ginseng herb he came for. Lastly, he prepares his belongings and leaves the city, saddened and heartbroken by the loss of his friend.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Part V: Savana

At nightfall, Bancai arrived in the kingdom of Savana, now accompanied by his friend Martin, and without their other friend, John. Their goal this time was to find the Ginseng Herb. Initially, Bancai was surprised by the warm welcome from the citizens of Savana, and the grand feast laid out before them. At first, he thought it was a festival or celebration, until one of the locals approached him.

Local: "You're Bancai, the one who won the Hal competition. Everyone's talking about your strength and how you defeated Ares."

Bancai looked around at the people and spotted the warrior who he had defeated in the first round of the competition, The Howari. He went to talk to him, but The Howari refused, simply expressing pity for him for entering their kingdom.

Bancai was puzzled by what was said, then returned to his place with Martin. Some people began conversing in an unfamiliar language, but luckily, Martin understood.

Martin: "Let's get out of here. They want you to be the sacrifice for their monster."

Bancai: "What sacrifice and what monster?"

Martin: "There's a monster, resembling a lizard, that appears every year to devour a strong person. They want you to be their sacrifice."

Bancai: "Why?"

Martin: "Because you're not from this kingdom, and because you're strong. You also have some other requirements that I don't know."

Bancai: "Could that black thing that appeared in my last fight be related?"

Martin: "I think so."

Bancai and Martin quickly left the feast. However, the king arrived with a senior elder, questioning where they were going as the celebration had not yet begun. Bancai didn't want to let the residents know about their plan, so he sat, thinking of a way to escape. He figured the only solution was to fight the monster.

After a few moments, Bancai was struck on the head and lost consciousness. When he woke up, he found himself bound in a stable with Martin lying on the ground. Martin had been struck a few times, enough to render him unconscious, as he hadn't fully recovered from his fight in Hal. Fortunately, Bancai had a knife he had taken from the feast before fainting.

Meanwhile, the elder was speaking in an incomprehensible language, perhaps casting a spell, and throwing some herbs onto the fire before him. Bancai cut the rope without the elder noticing and struck him forcefully in anger. The elder, angered, revealed his true form, transforming into a gigantic lizard. Bancai initially struggled against the elder, falling to the ground, but then he transformed, just like what happened in the Hal competition. This time too, he couldn't control his power and defeated the elder, who had turned into a lizard. He then took the severed head of the elder to the people of Savana, freeing them from the monster they had feared.

The people rejoiced in their victory, but Bancai suddenly collapsed from exhaustion. Afterward, when he woke up, he and his friend were presented with the Ginseng Herb they had come for. Only one ingredient remained: the Ginkgo Biloba Herb in the Canavar Cave. But before that, he needed to visit the doctor to understand the reason behind his mysterious strength. Bancai arrived at the doctor's.

Doctor: "What disease did your mother suffer from?"

Bancai: "The doctor in Stourm refused to tell me the name of the disease."

Doctor: "The medicine needs the Ginseng Herb and also what else? Tell me everything about your journey."

After Bancai informed the doctor about the other ingredients and how he obtained them, the doctor understood his condition.

Doctor: "You're the son of the legend Mihawk, aren't you? I see. Your mother suffers from Anargyria, a disease resulting from the War of the Kaidoz. As for your strength, it's a curse. You need to take the Sinestro Glove and place a stone in the hole in the palm. Fortunately, I have that stone. But you'll find the glove in the Yaskeena Cave between Savana and the Canavar Forest. You won't find anyone to ask in Canavar, so I'll tell you where to find the last herb, the Ginkgo Biloba. It's in the Canavar Cave, in the middle of the forest. You'll find it inside the waterfall. But be careful, your fight there will be the toughest yet, as the guardian won't show mercy. Also, as you know, the Kaidoz Jar they sealed is there."

After this advice, Bancai left, with Martin staying behind to hear some words from the doctor.

Doctor to Martin: "Keep an eye on your friend, and don't let him fight before he finds the glove. He might die fighting. You have to fight in his place. Here's some medicine; drink it to heal your wounds. You're stronger than you think. Don't hide your strength and defend your friend with it."

After these words, Martin felt that John's death was because of him. If he had been stronger, he could have defeated Ares in the second round, and John wouldn't have had to fight in the semi-finals. But the regret quickly faded, as he now had to save his friend's mother.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Part VI: Canavar

Bancai and his friend packed up all their belongings and herbs they had obtained, along with the Sinestro Stone, and now they headed towards the Yaskeena Cave to acquire the glove.

Upon reaching the cave, they found a large monster guarding the entrance, making this encounter more perilous than the Rosenbelle Palace or the Winterland Cemetery. With no other option but to fight the monster, Martin insisted on facing it alone at first, but his attempts proved futile. Bancai eventually joined him, and together they managed to defeat the creature, allowing Bancai to obtain the glove. When he placed the Sinestro Stone into the hole on the glove's palm, a shock coursed through his hand, causing immense pain. However, he also felt a surge of power, amplified by the blows he had received from the monster. Now, he felt capable of defeating any creature, bolstered by his newfound strength.

Afterward, they continued on their journey towards the next cave, Canavar, where they would find the last ingredient. Along the way, they faced many difficulties, battling monsters from the kingdom of Bits. This kingdom was inhabited entirely by biological creatures, as Suduma had conducted experiments on them after killing their king and seizing their lands. Only a few humans remained, hiding in the forest and Canavar, while some had fled to other territories, totaling less than two hundred in number. Bancai encountered some of these survivors, offering them food and protection from the Bits monsters chasing them.

Finally, they reached a river, which they followed as it originated from the waterfall inside the Canavar Cave. They arrived at the cave, where their journey would come to an end, and they would hopefully save Bancai's mother.

Upon entering the cave, they found it vast and devoid of any guards at the entrance. Martin suspected they might be deeper inside. As they walked a little further, they encountered three forks in the path. One of these paths would lead to the jar containing the Kaidoz monsters, left unguarded but cursed so that whoever entered would not leave the cave alive. Another path led to the herb they had come for, and the third path led to an endless circular loop from which no one could escape.

1. The first path was marked: "The path that ascends to the yellow sky, is the path that brings life to the dead."
2. The second path was marked: "who sees the unseen will find the key within the illusion."
3. The third path was marked: "who seeks salvation shall follow the lone star in the sea of darkness."

Martin: "What will you choose, Bancai?"

Bancai: "I don't know. If we choose the wrong path, we might die."

Martin: "In the first path, bringing life to the dead, don't you think that's it? Because the herb is medicinal and it heals those who would die. What does 'yellow sky' mean?"

Bancai: "I don't know, but maybe it refers to the dead being the Kaidoz monsters."

Martin: "What about the second path? I think 'seeing the unseen' refers to the empty loop."

Bancai: "But it could also mean the Kaidoz monsters."

Martin: "Or perhaps it refers to the illness we want to cure your mother from."

Bancai: "What does 'salvation' mean in the third path sentence?"

Martin: "I think it's our way to salvation from this problem and finding the herb."

Bancai: "Or perhaps it's speaking to those inside who couldn't escape. I think it's the final loop."

Martin: "Or perhaps it's the salvation of the Kaidoz monsters from their imprisonment."

After this conversation, Bancai stopped thinking as he heard his friend's words, "bringing life to your mother." He found the solution in the first path because the second led to the monsters and the third to the endless loop.

Bancai succeeded in his choice. After a few meters, he found the herb growing on a small hill of rare yellow soil resembling gold.

Bancai took the herb and was overjoyed. Their journey had finally ended. Now, he would save his mother.

But Martin felt something strange. Didn't the doctor from the Kingdom of Savana mention that the cave had powerful guards? He hadn't seen any guards since entering. He didn't want to burden Bancai with this now. They needed to leave.

Bancai and his friend moved from the spot, and when they reached the place where they had chosen one of the three paths, they found a heavily muscular man lying on the ground next to two others. One was holding a strong-looking knife, and the other held a large jar in his hand. They turned to face him, and one of them said, "Finally, your foolish journey has come to an end. Bancai recognized them now; it was Ares and his friend John."

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The Last Part: The Final War of the Kaidouz

While Bancai and Martin were in shock, Ares smashed the jar, and a scream emanated from it. Bancai and Martin were pushed backward by the force of the released Kaidouz creatures, and smoke filled the entire continent of Espada.

The kings of the other kingdoms witnessed this and ordered their armies to march to war. What they feared had come to pass.

King of Storm Kingdom: "This is our son; we must save him from our past mistakes."

King of Rosenbelle Kingdom: "Now we shall demonstrate our strength to protect our homeland and repay Bancai. We shall eradicate all Kaidouz. I know Suduma Kingdom is behind this. Today, that kingdom will fall."

King of Winterland Kingdom: "In a war like this, my father died. Today, I shall avenge him. Suduma Kingdom, I'll return to marry you, Princess Rosenbelle."

The people of Bummer moved without a leader, rushing into the Canavar Forest.

King of Savana Kingdom: "We are grateful for what Bancai did for us. He saved many lives. The Lizard Monster would have taken us. We must thank him in our own way."

King of Suduma Kingdom: "This is my chance to conquer other kingdoms. I know you won't disappoint me, John."

Back in the cave, Bancai approached the man lying on the ground, wondering who he was.

Martin said, "Now I know who you are. You are the legendary man, Mihawk."

Bancai exclaimed, "You are my father!"

Mihawk replied, "Are you Bancai?"

The family was reunited, but it wasn't the time for conversation. They faced a grave threat from the Kaidouz on one side and Ares and John on the other.

Mihawk retreated due to his severe injuries; he couldn't even stand.

Bancai hid the glove and held the Inma Stone in his hand. He received blow after blow until his strength multiplied again. Martin fought Ares, finishing his unresolved conflict from Hal. Bancai, on the other hand, fought John. Initially, Bancai couldn't match John's strength, even when combining their powers. But as his strength doubled once more, he defeated John, who lay defeated on the ground. Bancai didn't want to kill him; he knew John had his own secrets.

Martin suggested, "Stop the time, and prevent the jar from being opened."

Bancai replied, "If we can't kill all the Kaidouz, then it won't matter. John isn't the only one who wants this; all the villains in this world, especially Suduma Kingdom, do. While they were talking, the King of Suduma Kingdom, unnoticed, struck Bancai from behind. As Bancai fell, the Inma Stone slipped from his hand. Ares then unexpectedly attacked from behind, striking Martin. Ares was later killed by Martin. Bancai attempted to retrieve the glove, but the Suduma soldiers who accompanied the king attacked him. Sadly, more than 20 seconds passed since John's death; Bancai couldn't turn back time to save him. John had truly died this time, and the sorrow was deeper. Bancai had seen his friend die twice now, and this time, he held a secret in his heart. In a moment of anger and grief, the curse vanished from him. He approached his fallen friend, Martin, and his father, Mihawk, who was still recovering. The other kings of the kingdoms also gathered around him as he lay on the ground.

Bancai said, "Why did you leave us, Father?"

Mihawk replied, "I was assigned to guard the Kaidouz jar."

Bancai said, "Then you can come back with us, Father."

Mihawk agreed, "Yes, I'll return home with you."

Bancai pondered, "I wished to know why you helped John, Suduma Kingdom. What did Ares say to you? I know it wasn't for your own benefit but to save someone."

Bancai handed his bag to Mihawk.

Bancai said, "Go and give it to the doctor. Tell my mother my story; she will surely be interested."

Mihawk replied, "Why don't you tell her yourself?"

Bancai explained, "You know, Father, in the end, John and I are similar. We want to save others, and our lives don't matter to us. I never considered John my enemy, and neither did he, even in our fight in the cave."

Mihawk expressed, "Although our meeting was brief, I admired you and your friends. I'm sorry I didn't fulfill the role of a good father."

Bancai's final breath escaped him. He didn't hear his father's last words, but he died holding his father's hand tightly, like a small child. Bancai's story ended here.

In the end:

In the Storm Kingdom:
The mother was saved from her illness, and a statue of Bancai was erected to commemorate his contribution to saving humanity from the threat of the Kaidouz and Suduma Kingdom.

Mihawk retired from wielding the sword and fathered another child with the same courage as his elder brother.

In the Rosenbelle and Winterland Kingdoms:
The princess married the king of Winterland, and they had a child named Raja, after the king's father, Raja, who died in the Kaidouz war.

In the Bummer Kingdom:
Yes, it became a kingdom again after the restoration of the monarchy and the installation of Hawari as its king. His mother was from that kingdom, and they recognized his heroism. Hawari also amended the rules of the Hal competition; weapons were banned, and even lethal blows were prohibited, making it a clean competition.

In the Savana Kingdom:
Martin opened a martial arts training hall to teach children what he learned from his grandfather, Bancai.

In the Bits Kingdom:
The citizens returned to rebuild their land. As for the Bits monsters, a cure was developed to return them to their human form.

In the Visors Kingdom:
It's not a new kingdom but one that was annexed by Suduma Kingdom. It regained its rule after the fall of Suduma Kingdom.

And thus, our story ends, recounting the journey of the hero Bancai and his quest to save his mother, which turned into a journey to save the world.
